		File too big? Multipart archives scawy? Filefrag is here to help!<br>
		While multipart archives are great, being able to make a simple text record of binary parts of a file can be better sometimes.<br>
		Or something. I guess. I use my own filefrag tool to split single files, though I'll probably use multipart 7zips for many files.<br>
		Anyways here are the tools. They aren't great, and they might take some figuring out, but they do work, and it's useful to split a file across many domains, e.g.

		FileFrag splits and concats files into binary blocks, the same way multipart archives do, but for any file.<br>
		With this project I also aim to provide a sturdy-ish format for multipart file download records. (v2+)<br>
		I use my own filefrag tool around the site. You can tell which version is used based on the extension. I'll try to update them all though.

	<h3>FileFrag versions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="./v1/index.html">v1</a> (.filefrag.bin) Is mid. The format is a wreck. Can still split your files, though.</li>
		<li><a href="./v2/index.html">v2</a> (.ff.yaml)</li>
