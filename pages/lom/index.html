<h1>Lord of Mysteries</h1>
<h2>It's nice, trust me</h2>

<p>
	Chinese isekai, if you want to be reductive about it. Also the greatest book I've ever read<br>
	The novel is anything but light, but the payoff of having the time to build everything up and coming to realizations about the scale of it all is worth all 1432 chapters of it.

<h3>Novel</h3>
<p>
	These are the epubs made by Qidian. They sometimes lose professionalism (the translations and formatting will break for a while near the end of vol. 4 and the start of vol. 5) but it's the best version we have for now (an official translation and publishing by Yen Press is soon to come).<br>

<h3>Donghua</h3>
<p>
	It's coming soon.
</p>

<h3>Manhua</h3>
<p>
	There are now two manhuas, the old one and the remake. Fild them on manganato, mangadex, etc.<br>
	Treat these as like a trial edition of the novel (though we'll have to see where the remake goes, for now it seems very good).<br>
	<br>
	For the old version, its 65 chapters only cover about 2/3rds of the first volume; its chapter 65 corresponds to chapter 104 of the novel.

<h1>Circle of Inevitability</h1>
<h2>The sequel</h2>

<p>
	I am yet to gather anything for it, as it was just completed recently. There should be some more refined fan publishing soon enough, though. Who knows how long it'll take until Yen Press gets to this one.
