<h1>Lord of Mysteries</h1>
<h2>It's nice, trust me</h2>

<p>
	By technicality this is an isekei story but it's Chinese so it's actually really in-depth.<br>
	The novel is anything but light and, as of writing this, the current 65 chapters of the manhua only cover 2/3 of the first of eight volumes comprising the first book.<br>
	Along the same lines, the comic is much more summarised than the novel. If you still want a correspondance, manhua ch65 = novel vol1ch104.
</p>

<h3>Manhua</h3>
<p>
	I don't care much for the comic, but it can serve as a sample. I stil reccomend starting the novel from the start after this.<br>
	Again, if you'd like to correspond from the end of the manhua to the novel, chapter 65 here is about chapter 104 of the first volume of the novel. You should probably go a few chapters back to get used to the style and details that are absent.<br>
