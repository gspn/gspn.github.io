	<h1>The Ad Wars</h1>
	<h2>A lesson in perverse incentives</h2>
	<sup>Article reccomendation by the Pringles fucker</sup>

	<br><hr>
	<p>
		So youtube did a bit of a stupid.<br>
		They tried to block ad blockers, so obviously we made ad-blocker-blocker-blockers.<br>
		Although this page was started because of the youtube ad wars, this will also serve as a general repository for ad and tracker blocking. The links will be stored at the end.<br>
	</p>
	<h3>The Basics</h3>
	<p>
		Winning the ad wars on youtube is already simple enough. For one, the godsends at uBlock are regularly updating their adblock filters to bypass whatever spy-gadgety observer youtube has for detecting them.<br>
		My personal setup uses <s>fadblock</s> (see edit) + adnauseam. The one who requested this article uses fadblock + brave shield. What do these do and what are their pros and cons? Glad you asked!
	</p>
	<h3>Personal reccomendations</h3>
	<p>
		This part is quite short but also descriptive. <br>
		<br>
		<s>Firstly, fadblock is functionally an ad<i>skipper</i>, fast-forwarding the media element of video ads on youtube.</s><br>
	</p>
	<ul><s><p>
		+ Youtube can't detect it. Ha!<br>
		+ Plays well with other blockers<br>
		- Some hitches (ads might play for half a second)
	</p></s></ul>
	<p>
		(edit: fadblock is no longer necessay, uBo does a better job. also it vaguely has some malware-like stuff in it since about 2024)<br>
		<br>
		And secondly, adnauseam is based on uBlock Origin and obfuscates whatever data the ads can still get before they're nuked by spamming requests in the background. To my understanding, this may also register the reward at the ad service, which helps creators (although youtube finds every way to take that revenue away).
	</p>
	<ul><p>
		+ Based on uBo<br>
		+ Messes with trackers<br>
		- Uses more bandwidth
	</p></ul>
	<p>
		I won't go into brave shield, since it's not an extension or script and that's a topic for the browser debate.
	</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		Youtube is dumb and hasn't heard of the cobra effect even once, somehow, despite being a host to probably a few thousand videos about it. Also turns out I <i>can</i> write. Huh. First actually fleshed-out article on this website.<br>
<br>
		You can probably expect the start of my "villain" tool soon, which will implement various kinds of tracking, fingerprinting, and advertisement for anyone to test their blockers against or simply help out by providing me with, like, 7Â¥ of ad revenue.
