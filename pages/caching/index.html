<h1>Caching</h1>
<h2>What you need to know about running these pages offline</h2>

<h3>Cache icons and tags</h3>
<p>
	These little pucks tell you the status of a page in cache:
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:grey">UNTRACKED</span> means the page isn't in cache</li>
	<li><span style="color:green">FRESH</span> means the page has been cached recently (less than a day old)</li>
	<li><span style="color:yellow">STALE</span> means you should re-cache if you're expecting changes (less than a week
		old)</li>
	<li><span style="color:red">OLD</span> means you should definitely re-cache it, unless you're certain nothing
		important has changed (older than a week)</li>
	<li><span style="color:red">ERROR</span> means the cache update failed in any way. This is most commonly just trying
		to update cache while offline.</li>
</ul>
You can click the cachetag to attempt an update of the cache for the associated file.

<h3>Errors</h3>
<h4>"Service Worker API not available, for some reason."</h4>
<p>
	I don't believe in easy answers. Instead, I specialize in leaving you scratching your head and
	muttering, "for some reason?" The service worker may or may not be on vacation, but hey, that's the beauty of it. In
	the end, you'll either fix the problem or become best friends with the refresh button. It's a win-win!
</p>
<h4>"Sorry m8: ERROR &lt;number&gt;"</h4>
<p>
	This little fella appears when you get an http error when trying to load a page.
</p>
<h4>"Error: Sorry m8:"</h4>
<p>
	Creature of darkness conjured by trying to access an untracked page offline. Even I don't know why it gets formatted
	this way.
